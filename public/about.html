<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Gunti Ganesh, a passionate seeker of knowledge and a fervent 
  enthusiast of technology, hailing from the vibrant city of Hyderabad, India.
  As I narrate the story of my life thus far, I invite you to embark on a 
 journey filled with determination, curiosity, and the relentless pursuit of
  excellence.</p>
 <p> Born and raised in the heart of Hyderabad, I was nurtured amidst the rich
 culture and dynamic environment of this bustling metropolis. From a young age,
I exhibited a natural curiosity for how things worked, often disassembling and
 reassembling gadgets to understand their mechanisms. This innate curiosity laid
 the foundation for my journey into the world of technology.</p>
